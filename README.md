# Corsac

command line tools for Firefox OS development

## Corsac goal

    - Corsac project is based on Mozilla Cuddlefish (a.k.a "cfx")
        - https://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk/wiki/cfx-py
    - The ideia is provide a cool and productive cli for Firefox OS developers.

### Why the project is called 'corsac'

Corsac is a fox specie ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsac_fox)), and thinking in a tool for Firefox OS, nothing else cool to use that a fox :)
